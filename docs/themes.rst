Supported themes
================

This project generates a consistent version selector menu irrespective of the sphinx theme,
hence, it should natively support all themes in which sphinx supports either sidebars or footers.

Some of the tested themes are:

|Build|

- sphinx_rtd_theme
- astropy_sphinx_theme
- sphinx_book_theme
- pydata_sphinx_theme
- furo
- alabaster
- sphinxdoc
- pyramid
- bizstyle
- traditional
