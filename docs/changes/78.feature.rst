Added support for configuration file arguments. These arguments can be defined in `conf.py`.
Arguments can be defined in `conf.py` as long as the argument name is predeced by ``sv_``.
For example: `select_branch` becomes `sv_select_branch`.
Specific info about the arguments is available in documentation under settings topic.
