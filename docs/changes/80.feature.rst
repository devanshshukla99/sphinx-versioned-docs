Added regex support for selecting and excluding branches and tags.
Now, any branch can be selected by mentioning it in ``--branch``/ ``--b`` and any can be excluded by adding a ``-``
infront of the branch/tag name in the argument.

Suppose there are 3 branches and tags: ``main, v1.0, v2.0``.
The argument ``--branch main,-v*`` will select ``main`` and will exclude ``v1.0`` and will exclude ``v2.0``.
Similarly, the argument ``--branch -main,v*`` will select ``v1.0`` and ``v2.0`` and will exclude ``main``.
